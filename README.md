# configs

dump some of my config stuff here

Ok, I should probably include important notes about the purpose and reminders for myself when moving to new workstations

The purpose of this repo is to have a 1 script installation of userland configuration (packages, editor settings, etc) so that I can maintain parity across different workstations
